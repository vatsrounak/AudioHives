# AudioHives : Spotify Playlist Downloader

This is a Node.js project that allows you to download songs from a Spotify playlist using YouTube as the source. The script uses the Spotify Web API to fetch playlist details, searches for each track on YouTube, and downloads the audio files.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhi6722/AudioHives
```

2. Change into the project directory.

```bash
cd AudioHives
```

3. Install the required npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

1. Obtain your Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) and update them in the `config.js` file:

```javascript
// config.js
module.exports = {
    spotify: {
      clientId: 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID',
      clientSecret: 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET',
    },
    youtube: {
      apiKey: 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY',
    },
  };
```

## Usage

1. To start the download process, simply run:
```bash
npm start
```

2. The script will run the index.js file and then we can open the [http://localhost:8888/login](http://localhost:8888/login) and login into our Spotify Account and then after that we can see the Access token in our terminal.

3. Now we have to copy the access token and paste ```getMe.js``` file in the token variable.
```
const token = "YOUR_GENERATED_ACCESS_TOKEN";
```

4. Now we have to run the getMe.js file in another terminal using the command
```
node getMe.js
```

5. The script will fetch the playlist details from Spotify, search for each track on YouTube, and download the audio files. The downloaded songs will be saved in the `songs` directory.

## Notes

- Make sure you have the required npm packages installed as mentioned in the `package.json` file.
- The script will download the audio of the first YouTube search result for each track. If you want to customize this behavior, you can modify the `downloadYouTubeVideo` function in the `youtube.js` file.
